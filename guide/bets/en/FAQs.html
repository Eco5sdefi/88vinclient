<p><strong>Placing bets and settlement</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How do I place a bet?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, log in with your username and password. Select one or several bets from our line-up and use the mouse to click on an estimated outcome. Your bet will then appear in the bet slip on the right-hand side of the page. Next, specify the amount you wish to stake and your preferred type of bet (single, system or chain). In the third and final phase, you can either confirm the bet or cancel it. Please note that our General Terms and Conditions do not permit the cancellation of any bets once they have been placed.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What are the types of bets?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can choose different types of bets. Starting with one prediction, you can use the &ldquo;Single&rdquo; bet option (single), with two or more predictions you can place &ldquo;Express&rdquo; bets, and with three or more predictions you can place a &ldquo;System&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chain&rdquo; bet. And if you would prefer to place &ldquo;Single&rdquo; or &ldquo;System&rdquo; bets, you need to select the desired option.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What is a &ldquo;Single&rdquo; bet?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A &ldquo;Single&rdquo; bet is the simplest form of betting. You predict an outcome, specify the desired stake and place the bet. If your prediction is correct, you win the bet. The winnings are calculated by multiplying the odds by the stake.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What is an &ldquo;Express&rdquo; bet and how is it calculated?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Express&rdquo; is a bet consisting of two or more events in which a necessary condition is that none of the events should lose. &ldquo;Express&rdquo; bets&rsquo; total odds are calculated by multiplying the odds of all the individual predictions.</span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Which bets can be combined to form an &ldquo;Express&rdquo; bet?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of the offered bets may be combined freely in an &ldquo;Express&rdquo; bet. There are a few exceptions, however, such as certain Formula &ndash; 1 bets that can only be placed as &ldquo;Single&rdquo; bets. The bookmakers decide which bets can be combined, and their decision is based on various factors, such as the respective game or the event. You will be informed of their decision by the time the bets are placed. Please note: several bets on the same event/outcome cannot be placed as an &ldquo;Express&rdquo; or &ldquo;System&rdquo; bet.</span></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; What is the&rdquo; Chain&rdquo; bet and how is it calculated?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A &ldquo;Chain&rdquo; bet is a combination of &ldquo;Single&rdquo; bets on events independent of each other. The customer choses the order of the bets included in the chain and the unit. The unit stake is placed on the first selection as a single. If this generates a return, the unit stake is deducted from the winnings and placed on the second selection and so on until the chain is complete or all funds are lost. If at any stage there is not enough funds on the bet to cover the unit stake then the total remaining balance is staked and the chain continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the first event ~ $6 is generated, from which ~ $3 is transferred to the next event as the sum of the bet. And ~ $3 is transferred to the &ldquo;chain account&rdquo;. From the second event being won ~$4.50 is generated, from which ~ $3 is transferred as a bet sum for the next event, and the remaining ~$1.50 is transferred to the &ldquo;chain account&rdquo; and the sum is ~ $4.50. As the third event is lost, ~ $3 is taken from the chain account for the fourth event, and only ~ $1.5 remains in the account. After the win fourth event is won ~ $9 is generated, ~ $3 of this sum is transferred as the bet sum for the fifth event and ~ $6 is added to the &ldquo;chain account&rdquo;, and the sum of the chain account becomes ~ $7.50. The fifth event is lost; this means that the winnings of this chain are ~ $7.50, the same amount as in the &ldquo;chain account&rdquo;.</span></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What is the &ldquo;System&rdquo; bet? How is it calculated and how much is the minimum sum of each bet?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;System&rdquo; is a bet which consists of at least three events. The program forms variants of the events you have selected. For example, if you select a 2/5 system, it means that at least 2 events from 5 must win for the bet to win. The minimum sum of each bet depends on the selection of the system.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handicap is a head start given to a selection expressed in goals/points/sets/frames etc. depending on the type of the competition. The handicap is offered by the bookmaking company and it can be &ldquo;positive&rdquo; (1), &ldquo;negative&rdquo; (-1) and &ldquo;zero&rdquo;. For example, if you made a bet on &ldquo;Handicap 1(2)&rdquo; on a football match, this means you allowed Team 1 a 2 - goal &lsquo;head start&rsquo;.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the match ends 1-1, then adding the handicap will produce a score of 3-1 and the bet will win.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the match ends 0-3, then adding the handicap will produce a score of 2-3 and the bet will lose.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the match ends 0-2, then adding the handicap will produce a score of 2-2 and the bet will result in a push (stakes returned).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the handicap is &ldquo;negative&rdquo;, you need to subtract rather than add.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few other examples of a handicap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bet W1 Handicap (-1) can win only when the home team wins the match by two goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bet W2 Handicap (1) can win only when the away team does not lose the match (draw or victory of the away team).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bet X Handicap (1) can win only when the home team wins the match by one goal (or when the away team loses by one goal).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bet X Handicap (-1) can win only when the home team loses the match by one goal (if the away team wins by one goal).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bet W1 Handicap (-2) can win only when the home team wins the match by three goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bet W2 Handicap (2) can win only in the following result of the match:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A draw</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victory of the home team by one goal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any victory by the away team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bet X Handicap (2) can win only when the home team wins by two goals.</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What is a &ldquo;Hattrick&rdquo;?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A &ldquo;Hattrick&rdquo; bet means that one of the players of the two teams should score three or more goals during the match.</span></p>

<ol start="9">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What do W1/W2, W1/X, X/W2 and other bets mean?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of bet is halftime/fulltime betting, the first symbol shows the result of the first half, and the second symbol shows the result of the game. For example, W1/W2 bet means that the first team has won in the first half but the second team has won in the total game. W1/X bet means that the first team has won in the first half, and the overall game has ended in a draw.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maximum winnings for one customer over a 24-hour period is 400,000,000. If the bet comes with a bonus, and the winning sum exceeds 200,000,000, the bonus is not paid.</span></p>
<ol start="13">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What is the maximum odds for express or system bets?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maximum odds for express or system bets is 1000. Bets that exceed 1000, are calculated at 1000 odds.</span></p>
